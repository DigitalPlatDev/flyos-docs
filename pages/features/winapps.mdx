# Run Windows applications
FlyOS comes pre-installed with the WINE and architecture emulator, which means you can run amd64/x86 Windows applications on your aarch64 Android device. It's really cool, isn't it?
## Run winecfg

export const Tipsdesktop = () => {
return (
    <Callout emoji="ðŸ¤”">
    WINE runs on the FlyOS desktop, so we will start FlyOS Desktop first
    </Callout>
  );
};

<Tipsdesktop/>


Open Terminal First

To run WINE, we need to use the command ```startwine<arch>```, which is a built-in command in FlyOS. For example, if you want to start an x86 application, you would type ```startwine86 <app name or path>``` in the terminal. For instance, typing ```startwine86 winecfg``` and hitting enter will launch winecfg.

For example:
```bash
startwine86 winecfg
```
Enter    
then you will see:    
<div>
    <img src="/imgs/wine.png" alt="wine" style={{ width: '50%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
Similarly, if you want to run amd64 apps, just replace ```startwine86``` to ```startwine64```!
```bash
startwine64 winecfg
```
