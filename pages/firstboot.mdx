# First boot
### Launch the subsystem through FlyOS Manager
You should be able to find the **FlyOS Manager** application on the Android launcher. Open it up!    
After open it, your superuser manager will prompt you to grant superuser (root) permissions to FlyOS Manager. Click **"grant"**.    
When you open FlyOS Manager, it should look like this:    

<div>
    <img src="/imgs/manager.png" alt="manager" style={{ width: '50%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

You can manage the start, stop, and view logs of the FlyOS subsystem here
<div>
    <img src="/imgs/usbdebug.png" alt="manager usb debugging" style={{ width: '50%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
Upon the initial launch of FlyOS, you may be prompted with "Allow USB Debugging." Please check "Always Allow from this computer" and click "Allow." This is an authorization for the FlyOS Framework and is an important part to ensure the proper functioning of FlyOS Framework and subsystem.    
<div>
    <img src="/imgs/manager_started.png" alt="manager started" style={{ width: '50%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

After starting, open the FlyOS Dashboard by entering http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://(device IP):5000 (on other device) (default port 5000) into your browser. This will take you to the FlyOS Dashboard and guide you through the subsystem setup    

### Launch the subsystem through shell

```sh
sh /data/flyos/bin/flyos -b
```
Which mean ```-b, --boot```, Boot FlyOS Container
